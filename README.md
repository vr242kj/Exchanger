# Exchanger
A table with exchange rates from the National Bank website appears on the page (https://bank.gov.ua/ua/open-data/api-dev).  
If there is no recorded date in the localStorage, then the table shows the exchange rate for today, if there is a record, then it takes the date from the localStorage.  
The user has the option to choose the date himself.  
At the bottom, under the table, it is possible to convert the currency.  
To do this, you need to enter the amount of money in UAH and the desired currency for conversion. After that press the button "Convert".
